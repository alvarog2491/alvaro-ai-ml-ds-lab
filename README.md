# AI/ML/Data Science Projects 🤖📊

Personal repository for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science projects implemented in Python, R, and other technologies.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by discipline and technology, allowing for diverse projects across different domains:

```
├── machine-learning/      # Classical ML algorithms and techniques
├── deep-learning/         # Neural networks and deep learning
├── llm-projects/          # Large Language Models and NLP
├── data-science/          # Data analysis and visualization
└── mlops/                 # Deployment and production workflows
```

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Python Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:alvarog2491/alvaro-ai-ml-ds-lab.git
cd alvaro-ai-ml-ds-lab

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (when available)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### R Environment
```r
# Install required packages (project specific)
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "ggplot2"))
```

## 🚀 How to Navigate

**Browse by category**: Each folder contains projects of similar nature
**Check individual READMEs**: Each project has its own documentation

## 📈 Project Standards
